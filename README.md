# TR22-TempSensor
Temperature sensor code to monitor brake calipers on TR22

This is a simple arduino program using a slightly modified version of the demo code given by adafruit

The sensor used is the gy 609 ir temperature sensor and uses the adafruit MLX90614 library

The demo data set is me holding the ir sensor in the air, then putting it up to my monitor, then up to a cup that had been in the refrigerator
